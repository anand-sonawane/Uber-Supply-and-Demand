# Uber-Supply-and-Demand

  You all must have travelled to and from the airport. Have you anytime used Uber or in fact any other cab service to travel to and from the airport? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or the issue of non-availability of cars? Well if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.
  
# Objective

  Uber has identified that there is an issue with regard to availability of cars especially at the airport in one specific city where the airport is far away from the city. They want to identify why this issue exists. As an analyst at Uber and have been given the task to identify the cause behind this issue.
  
# Data

Request level data for the last 5 days to and from the Airport.

There are 6 attributes associated with each request id. These are:-

1) Date of request: The date on which the customer made the trip request
2) Time of request: The time at which the customer made the trip request
3) Drop-off time: The drop-off time, in case the trip was completed 
4) Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
5) Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
6) Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available

# Problems 
 
Problem 1 : 

During the morning rush to the airport the number of requests made to the airport from city are very high, on the other hand the trips that are completed are very less. When researched the reason behind this is a lot of drivers tend to cancel the trips to the airport in the morning because they get no fare back from the airport as the frequency of flights arriving are very less in the morning so the driver tends to cancel the trip to the airport.

Hence here, the supply is less and the demand is high at the city pickup points.

Possible Solution: Incentives can be given to the drivers for accepting trips which may result in a fare-less drip from the airport to the city. This will help to cope with the high demand at city pickup in the morning. This thus benefits all the stake holders, Customers,drivers and Uber.
